Generate the autocompletion script for bash

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the bash shell.

This script depends on the 'bash-completion' package.

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(blobfuse2 completion bash)

#### Linux:

	blobfuse2 completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/blobfuse2

#### macOS:

	blobfuse2 completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/blobfuse2

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
