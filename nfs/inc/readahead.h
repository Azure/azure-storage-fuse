/**
 * Readahead state for a Blob.
 * This maintains state to track application read pattern and based on that
 * can decide if readahead will help. If so, it can also perform the readahead
 * read IOs for the given file updating the cache appropriately. User can call
 * the issue_readaheads() method to issue all permitted readaheads at the time
 * of called. Only the READ RPCs are queued at libnfs in the calling thread
 * context. The actual send will be performed by the libnfs service thread of
 * the selected nfs context, and the callback will also be called in the
 * context of the same libnfs service thread.
 * Following are some of its properties:
 *
 * 1. User must call issue_readaheads() usually right after application read,
 *    in the same context. This will issue the required readahead read
 *    requests after the application read.
 * 2. issue_readaheads() will call the private method get_next_ra() method to
 *    find the offset of the next readahead read it should issue, and it'll
 *    issue all the suggested reads. Obviously it'll not issue any readahead
 *    read for random read pattern and also if there are already enough ongoing
 *    readahead reads.
 * 3. It should *never* suggest readahead for the same offset more than once
 *    if the reads are issued at monotonically increasing offsets.
 * 4. It should *never* suggest readahead for the same offset for which a read
 *    has been recently issued, if the reads are issued at monotonically
 *    increasing offsets.
 * 5. Since it tracks read IO pattern, it should be made aware of *all* reads
 *    issued by the application. Also, it should be told when a readahead
 *    completes.
 *
 * TODO: Currently it only tracks a single reader stream. If it's used in a
 *       scope where multiple reader applications are performing reads, it
 *       may not be able to correctly detect sequential patterns, even if all
 *       those multiple reader streams are sequential by themselves.
 *
 *       Another way of achieving the same is for the user to use multiple
 *       ra_state objects, one per reading context, f.e., one way of doing it
 *       is to associate the ra_state with the issuing process' (pid returned
 *       by fuse_get_context()) and not with the file inode.
 *
 *       Note that it would be ideal if fuse provided us info on the file
 *       pointer on whose behalf a specific IO is being issued. This would
 *       help us associate readahead state with a file pointer and not with
 *       the inode as the readahead (like read offset) is a property of the
 *       file pointer and not of the inode. In absence of this, above pid
 *       based readahead state maintenance is the next best thing we can do.
 *
 * How does pattern detection work?
 * ================================
 * File is divided into 1GB logical sections. Everytime access moves to a new
 * section, pattern tracking variables are reset (this is skipped for an
 * ongoing sequential access). This is done to make sure we use the most recent
 * accesses to correctly detect the pattern and older accesses do not muddle the
 * pattern detection. Following pattern tracking variables are maintained:
 *
 * - ra_bytes is the amount of readahead in bytes. We never keep more than
 *   ra_bytes of readahead reads ongoing.
 * - min_byte_read and max_byte_read track the min and max bytes read by the
 *   application in the current section. max_byte_read-min_byte_read is called
 *   the access_range.
 * - num_reads and num_bytes_read is the total number of reads and number of
 *   bytes read in the current section, respectively.
 * - If num_reads >= 3 and num_bytes_read/access_range > 0.7, the pattern is
 *   considered sequential. ((num_bytes_read * 100) / access_range) is called
 *   access_density as it represents how densely the reads are issued over a
 *   file range. Note that this allows for some reordered reads due to multiple
 *   async reads handled by multiple threads, but at the same time it marks the
 *   pattern sequential only when application is indeed reading sequentially.
 *   Note that random reads or "jumping reads" after a fixed gap will not meet
 *   the access_density threshold and hence will not qualify as sequential.
 * - Readahead windows starts from max_byte_read+1 and is ra_bytes wide.
 * - ra_ongoing is the number of readahead bytes which are still ongoing.
 * - last_byte_readahead is the last byte of readahead read issued, which means
 *   next readahead is issued from last_byte_readahead+1. When max_byte_read
 *   crosses last_byte_readahead, last_byte_readahead is updated to
 *   max_byte_read, so that we never issue readahead for something that's
 *   already read recently.
 * - Pattern tracking is reset when one of the following happens:
 *    - New read from the application lies in a different section than
 *      max_byte_read (and the current access is not sequential). This ensures
 *      our pattern detection is based on recent data and historical accesses
 *      do not have carry influence for long time.
 *    - New read starts after max_byte_read+ra_bytes. Such a large jump in
 *      read offset hints at non-sequential access and hence the access pattern
 *      need to be reviewed again and sequential pattern must be proved afresh.
 * - Following pattern tracking variables are reset:
 *    - min_byte_read
 *    - max_byte_read
 *    - num_reads
 *    - num_bytes_read
 *    - last_byte_readahead
 * - When pattern tracking is reset it'll take at least 3 reads to detect the
 *   pattern again. Till that time we won't recommend any new readaheads.
 *   Previously issued readaheads will continue and ra_ongoing is not reset.
