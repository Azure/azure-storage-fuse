/*
 * This is an entry in the unified readdir/DNLC cache.
 * Note that an entry can be added to the unified cache, via one of the
 * following:
 * 1. READDIRPLUS response.
 *    This creates the most complete entry with a valid cookie and a valid
 *    nfs_inode pointer (with attributes and filehandle).
 *    This can serve: READDIRPLUS, READDIR and LOOKUP requests.
 * 2. READDIR response.
 *    This creates an entry with a valid cookie but no nfs_inode pointer.
 *    Only attributes.st_ino (the inode number) is valid.
 *    This can serve: READDIR requests.
 * 3. LOOKUP response.
 *    This creates an entry with a special cookie (which is not possible in
 *    READDIR/READDIRPLUS responses) but a valid nfs_inode pointer.
 *    This can serve: LOOKUP requests. Though it has the nfs_inode pointer
 *                    it doesn't have the cookie, hence cannot serve directory
 *                    enumeration requests which need a valid cookie.
 *
 * Note: Blob NFS uses cookies starting at 1 and increasing by 1 for every
 *       file, so we use UINT64_MAX/2 as the starting value for the special
 *       cookie. This should never be returned in READDIR/READDIRPLUS response
 *       hence we won't mistake a type (3) entry as type (1).

 * Note on updating directory entries added in readdirectory_cache.
 *
 * READDIR and READDIRPLUS responses will always update old entries, deleting
 * existing ones and adding new ones. This means if we have a type (1) entry
 * and we get a READDIR response, it'll be deleted and a new type (2) entry
 * will be created.
 *
 * LOOKUP response will update the entry with the following rules:
 * Note that we don't want to blindly replace type (1) or (2) entries with
 * type (3) entries as those are not usable by READDIR/READDIRPLUS then.
 *
 * - If we have a type (1) entry and the new nfs_inode in the lookup response
 *   matches the saved one, don't do anything. This is the common case.
 * - If we have a type (1) entry and the new nfs_inode does not match the saved
 *   one, it means the file was either renamed or deleted and re-created. Next
 *   time when aznfsc_ll_readdir{plus}() is called it'll purge the entire
 *   readdir cache as the parent directory mtime would be different, thus
 *   ensuring correctness, but if lookup is called before readdir/readdirplus
 *   it'll delete the old entry and create a new type (3) entry.
 * - If we have a type (2) entry and the new nfs_inode matches the saved one,
 *   add nfs_inode and update directory_entry.attributes, thus promoting it to
 *   type (1). Only in this case we update nfs_inode in a directory_entry.
 * - If we have a type (2) entry and the new nfs_inode does not match the
 *   saved one, delete the old entry and create a new type (3) entry.
 * - If we have a type (3) entry and the new nfs_inode matches the saved one,
 *   don't do anything.
 * - If we have a type (3) entry and the new nfs_inode does not matche the
 *   saved one, delete the old entry and create a new type (3) entry.
