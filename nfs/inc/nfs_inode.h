     * - fuse_reply_create()

     *   affect the lookup count of any of the entries returned.
     *

     * we set the lookupcnt to 1 when the nfs_inode is created. Later if
     * we are not able to successfully convey creation of the inode to fuse
     * we drop the ref. This is important as unless fuse knows about an
     * inode it'll never call forget() for it and we will leak the inode.
     * forget() causes lookupcnt for an inode to be reduced by the "nlookup"
     * parameter count. forget_multi() does the same for multiple inodes in
     * a single call.
     * On umount the lookupcnt for all inodes implicitly drops to zero, and
     * fuse may not call forget() for the affected inodes.
     *
     * Till the lookupcnt of an inode drops to zero, we MUST not free the
     * nfs_inode structure, as kernel may send requests for files with
     * non-zero lookupcnt, even after calls to unlink(), rmdir() or rename().
     *
     * dircachecnt is another refcnt which is the number of readdirplus
     * directory_entry,s that refer to the nfs_inode. An inode can only be
     * deleted when both lookupcnt and dircachecnt become 0, i.e., fuse
     * vfs does not have a reference to the inode and it's not cached in
