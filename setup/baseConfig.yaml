  # Streaming configuration
stream:
  # If block-size-mb, blocks-per-file or cache-size-mb are 0, the stream component will not cache blocks. 
  block-size-mb: <size of each block to be cached in memory while streaming (in MB). Default - 0 MB>

  policy: lfu|lru|arc <cache eviction policy for cached blocks. Default - arc>
  cache-on-file-handle: true|false <cache block per file handle instead of file-name. (better performance but increases memory consumption)>

# Disk cache related configuration  
file_cache:
  # Required
  path: <path to local disk cache>

  # Optional
