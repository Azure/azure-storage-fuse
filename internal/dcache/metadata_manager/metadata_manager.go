// MetaDataManager defines the interface for managing metadata for the distributed cache.

// 1. Metadata for files stored in the distributed cache.
// 2. Metadata for internal files used by distributed cache, e.g., cluster map and heartbeat.

	// Succeeds only when the file metadata is not already present.
	// Returns an etag value that must be passed to the corresponding createFileFinalize().
