	// PutChunkDC puts an interesting demand on the RPC client pool manager.
	// PutChunkDC requires RPC clients for two distinct use cases:
	// 1. RPC clients needed to make the PutChunkDC call to the first nexthop node.
	//    This is called from WriteMV() invoked by file_manager when writing chunks from the writeback cache.
	// 2. RPC clients needed to make the PutChunkDC/PutChunk call to subsequent nodes in the daisy chain
	//    in response to a PutChunkDC call received from a previous node (or the local node).
	//
	// The important distinction to note here is that the RPC clients used by case (1) cannot be freed
	// till (2) gets the required RPC clients and complete their respective requests. There could be writes
	// going on any node which means (1) and (2) will contest for the same pool of RPC clients. If we issue
	// all RPC clients to (1), then there won't be any left for (2) and hence daisy chain requests from other
	// nodes will get stuck. The clients used by (1) may also be stuck due to the unavailability of clients
	// for (2) on other nodes. This can lead to a deadlock situation, where all clients are used up by (1) and
	// they cannot be freed as they need (2) to complete, but (2) doesn't have any clients to proceed.
	// Also note that demand for RPC clients by (2) is proportial to the RPC clients used by (1), as each of
	// those would result in a daisy chain of PutChunkDC/PutChunk calls to subsequent nodes.
	//
	// This brings us to two key observations:
	// 1. We need to prioritize (and reserve) RPC clients needed for (2) over (1). This is because RPC clients
	//    used by (1) will only be released when (2) completes.
	//    See nodeClientPool.numReservedHighPrio.
	// 2. We need to rate-limit the number of RPC clients used by (1) to a fraction of the total pool size.
	//    See GetRPCClientDummy().
	//
	// highPrio indicates if this client is used for high priority requests (case 2 above).
	//
