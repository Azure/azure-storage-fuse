// Primary goal of our read pattern tracker is to correctly identify parallel FUSE read requests as a result
// of a large application read as sequential. e.g., our target applications may issue large reads, say 10MiB,
// which FUSE will break down into multiple parallel reads, say 1MiB each. These 10x1MiB reads will be processed
// by multiple libfuse threads in non-deterministic order. The application will issue the next 10MiB read
// immediately adjacent to the previous 10MiB read, which is purely sequential reads. We should not consider
// the reordered 1MiB reads as random reads.
//
// We maintain a windowSize that determines how many such parallel reads can be active at any time. If Nth read
// is withing 2*windowSize of previous read, we consider it sequential. This is because the 1st read of prev batch
// and the last read of current batch can be processed one after another and will be 2*windowSize apart.
