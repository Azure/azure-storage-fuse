Build:
blobfuse was built from source using the build.sh build script.
Commit hash   22a58e3f75aa2516ed18f843e7b2dc8a929791ce


Mount command:
./blobfuse /mnt/mountdir --tmp-path=/mnt/blobfusetmp -o attr_timeout=240 -o entry_timeout=240 -o negative_timeout=120 --config-file=../connection.cfg

/mnt/blobfusetmp is on the temp disk, a 128 GB SSD. File cache timeout was 120 seconds; it does not appear that any of the operations hit the files in the file cache.


Stress parameters:

    std::vector<std::function<std::pair<size_t, size_t>(std::string, thread_pool&)>> populate_fns
    {
        populate_small,
        populate_large,
    };

        std::string source_dir("/mnt/src/src");  // Source directory for test data.  This is an SSD on my machine.  Should not be a blobfuse directory.  All contents will be wiped.
        std::string dest_dir_1("/home/asorrin/code/azure-storage-fuse-1/build/mountdir/stress");  // blobfuse directory to copy to.  All contents will be wiped.
        std::string dest_dir_2("/mnt/dst/dst");  // Local destination directory.  This is an SSD on my machine.  Should not be a blobfuse directory.  All contents will be wiped.

See output for additional parameters.
