# Blobfuse2 - A Microsoft supported Azure Storage FUSE driver
## About
Blobfuse2 is an open source project developed to provide a virtual filesystem backed by the Azure Storage. It uses the libfuse open source library (fuse3) to communicate with the Linux FUSE kernel module, and implements the filesystem operations using the Azure Storage REST APIs.
This is the next generation [blobfuse](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse)

Blobfuse2 is stable, and is ***supported by Microsoft*** provided that it is used within its limits documented here. Blobfuse2 supports both reads and writes however, it does not guarantee continuous sync of data written to storage using other APIs or other mounts of Blobfuse2. For data integrity it is recommended that multiple sources do not modify the same blob/file. Please submit an issue [here](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-fuse/issues) for any issues/feature requests/questions.

[This](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#config-guide) section will help you choose the correct config for Blobfuse2.

##  NOTICE
- We have seen some customer issues around files getting corrupted when `streaming` is used in write mode. Kindly avoid using this feature for write while we investigate and resolve it.
- You can now use block-cache instead of streaming for both read and write workflows, which offers much better performance compared to streaming. To enable `block-cache` instead of `streaming`, use `--block-cache` in CLI param or `block-cache` as component in config file instead of `streaming`.
## Supported Platforms
Visit [this](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse/wiki/Blobfuse2-Supported-Platforms) page to see list of supported linux distros.

## Features
- Mount an Azure storage blob container or datalake file system on Linux.
- Basic file system operations such as mkdir, opendir, readdir, rmdir, open, 
   read, create, write, close, unlink, truncate, stat, rename
- Local caching to improve subsequent access times
- Streaming/Block-Cache to support reading AND writing large files 
- Parallel downloads and uploads to improve access time for large files
- Multiple mounts to the same container for read-only workloads

## _New BlobFuse2 Health Monitor_
One of the biggest BlobFuse2 features is our brand new health monitor. It allows customers gain more insight into how their BlobFuse2 instance is behaving with the rest of their machine. Visit [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse/blob/main/tools/health-monitor/README.md) to set it up.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- How do I generate a SAS with permissions for rename?
az cli has a command to generate a sas token. Open a command prompt and make sure you are logged in to az cli. Run the following command and the sas token will be displayed in the command prompt.
az storage container generate-sas --account-name <account name ex:myadlsaccount> --account-key <accountKey> -n <container name> --permissions dlrwac --start <today's date ex: 2021-03-26> --expiry <date greater than the current time ex:2021-03-28>
- Why do I get EINVAL on opening a file with WRONLY or APPEND flags?
To improve performance, Blobfuse2 by default enables writeback caching, which can produce unexpected behavior for files opened with WRONLY or APPEND flags, so Blobfuse2 returns EINVAL on open of a file with those flags. Either use disable-writeback-caching to turn off writeback caching (can potentially result in degraded performance) or ignore-open-flags (replace WRONLY with RDWR and ignore APPEND) based on your workload. 
- How to mount blobfuse2 inside a container?
Refer to 'docker' folder in this repo. It contains a sample 'Dockerfile'. If you wish to create your own container image, try 'buildandruncontainer.sh' script, it will create a container image and launch the container using current environment variables holding your storage account credentials.
- Why am I not able to see the updated contents of file(s), which were updated through means other than Blobfuse2 mount?
If your use-case involves updating/uploading file(s) through other means and you wish to see the updated contents on Blobfuse2 mount then you need to disable kernel page-cache. `-o direct_io` CLI parameter is the option you need to use while mounting. Along with this, set `file-cache-timeout=0` and all other libfuse caching parameters should also be set to 0. User shall be aware that disabling kernel cache can result into more calls to Azure Storage which will have cost and performance implications. 

## Un-Supported File system operations
- mkfifo : fifo creation is not supported by blobfuse2 and this will result in "function not implemented" error
- chown  : Change of ownership is not supported by Azure Storage hence Blobfuse2 does not support this.
- Creation of device files or pipes is not supported by Blobfuse2.
- Blobfuse2 does not support extended-attributes (x-attrs) operations
- Blobfuse2 does not support lseek() operation on directory handles. No error is thrown but it will not work as expected.

## Un-Supported Scenarios
- Blobfuse2 does not support overlapping mount paths. While running multiple instances of Blobfuse2 make sure each instance has a unique and non-overlapping mount point.
- Blobfuse2 does not support co-existance with NFS on same mount path. Behaviour in this case is undefined.
- For block blob accounts, where data is uploaded through other means, Blobfuse2 expects special directory marker files to exist in container. In absence of this
  few file operations might not work. For e.g. if you have a blob 'A/B/c.txt' then special marker files shall exists for 'A' and 'A/B', otherwise opening of 'A/B/c.txt' will fail.
  Once a 'ls' operation is done on these directories 'A' and 'A/B' you will be able to open 'A/B/c.txt' as well. Possible workaround to resolve this from your container is to either

  create the directory marker files manually through portal or run 'mkdir' command for 'A' and 'A/B' from blobfuse. Refer [me](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse/issues/866) 
  for details on this.

## Limitations
- In case of BlockBlob accounts, ACLs are not supported by Azure Storage so Blobfuse2 will by default return success for 'chmod' operation. However it will work fine for Gen2 (DataLake) accounts.
- When Blobfuse2 is mounted on a container, SYS_ADMIN privileges are required for it to interact with the fuse driver. If container is created without the privilege, mount will fail. Sample command to spawn a docker container is 

    `docker run -it --rm --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --device=/dev/fuse --security-opt apparmor:unconfined <environment variables> <docker image>`
- In case of `mount all` system may limit on number of containers you can mount in parallel (when you go above 100 containers). To increase this system limit use below command
    `echo 256 | sudo tee /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances`

### Syslog security warning
By default, Blobfuse2 will log to syslog. The default settings will, in some cases, log relevant file paths to syslog. 
If this is sensitive information, turn off logging or set log-level to LOG_ERR.
