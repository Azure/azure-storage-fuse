- First Release

**Top Features**
- Compatibility with libfuse3, including libfuse2 compatibility for OSes that do not support libfuse3
- Service version upgrade from "2018-11-09" to "2020-04-08" (STG77) through the azure-go-sdk
- Maximum blob size in a single write 64MB -> 5000MB
- Maximum block size 100MB -> 4000MB
- Maximum file size supported 4.77TB -> 196TB
- File creation time and last access time now pulled from service 
- Passthrough directly from filesystem calls to Azure Storage APIs
- Read streaming (helpful for large files that cannot fit on disk)
- Logging to syslog or a file
- Mount a subdirectory in a container

- Encrypted config support 
- Present custom default permissions for files in block blob accounts
- Attribute cache invalidation based on timeout

**User Experience**

Blobfuse2 supports a special command that will accept the v1 CLI parameters and v1 config file format, convert it to a v2 config format and mount with v2. 

Blobfuse2 exposes all supported options in a clean yaml formatted configuration file in addition to a few common options exposed as CLI parameters. In contrast, Blobfuse exposes most of its options as CLI parameters and a few others in a key-value configuration file. 

**Validation**
Extensive suite of validation run with focus on scale and compatibility.

Various improvements/parity to existing blobfuse validated like

- Listing of >1M files: Parity under the same mount conditions.
- Git clone: Outperforms blobfuse by 20% in git clone (large repo, with over 1 million objects).
- resnet-50: Parity at 32 threads.
