# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml
#ci trigger on every branch so that private branch owners know if they have broken the build
#ci trigger on PR only for the master branch
